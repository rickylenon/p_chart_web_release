# Infinite Loop Fixes for Operations Listings

## Issues Identified

### 1. **localStorage State Restoration on New Browser Sessions**

**Location**: `src/pages/production-orders/index.tsx`
**Problem**: When opening the page for the first time in a new browser, the localStorage restoration logic was triggering unnecessary state updates and URL changes, potentially causing infinite loops.

**Fix Applied**:

- Added `isInitialized` flag to prevent multiple initialization attempts
- Added check for empty localStorage to prevent unnecessary state updates
- Improved early returns for new browser sessions

### 2. **Multiple useEffect Dependencies in Production Order Detail Page**

**Location**: `src/pages/production-orders/[poNumber].tsx`
**Problem**: Multiple useEffect hooks were calling `fetchProductionOrder()` with overlapping dependencies, causing circular re-renders and infinite loops.

**Fixes Applied**:

- Enhanced `fetchProductionOrder` callback with better early returns
- Added proper handling for `initialOrderData` to prevent redundant API calls
- Improved `initialLoadRef` management to prevent race conditions
- Consolidated data fetching logic into a single main effect

### 3. **Defects Fetching Race Conditions**

**Location**: `src/pages/production-orders/[poNumber].tsx`
**Problem**: The `fetchDefectsForOperation` function had race conditions where multiple calls could be triggered simultaneously, causing infinite loops.

**Fixes Applied**:

- Added immediate `lastFetchedTab` setting to prevent race conditions
- Enhanced validation to prevent unnecessary calls
- Added proper error handling with state reset on failures
- Improved early returns for invalid conditions

## Specific Changes Made

### Production Orders Index Page (`src/pages/production-orders/index.tsx`)

```typescript
// Before: Could cause infinite loops on new browser sessions
if (Object.keys(router.query).length === 0) {
  const savedParams = loadUrlFromLocalStorage();
  if (savedParams) {
    // ... set state and update URL
  }
}

// After: Better handling for new browser sessions
if (Object.keys(router.query).length === 0) {
  const savedParams = loadUrlFromLocalStorage();
  if (savedParams && Object.keys(savedParams).length > 0) {
    // ... set state and update URL
  } else {
    console.log(
      "No saved parameters found or localStorage empty - using defaults for new browser session"
    );
  }
}
```

### Production Order Detail Page (`src/pages/production-orders/[poNumber].tsx`)

1. **Enhanced fetchProductionOrder callback**:

   - Added proper handling for `initialOrderData`
   - Improved `initialLoadRef` management
   - Better error handling with ref reset

2. **Improved fetchDefectsForOperation**:

   - Added immediate `lastFetchedTab` setting
   - Enhanced validation and early returns
   - Better error handling with state reset

3. **Consolidated data fetching**:
   - Single main useEffect for production order fetching
   - Removed redundant router ready effect (recommended)

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Remove Redundant Router Effect

The router ready effect in `[poNumber].tsx` (lines ~1880-1920) should be removed as it duplicates the main data fetching logic and can cause infinite loops. The main production order fetch effect already handles all necessary conditions.

### 2. Add Debouncing for State Updates

Consider adding debouncing for rapid state updates, especially in the production orders listing page:

```typescript
const debouncedStateUpdate = useMemo(
  () =>
    debounce((newState) => {
      // Update state
    }, 300),
  []
);
```

### 3. Implement Better Loading States

Add more granular loading states to prevent multiple simultaneous API calls:

```typescript
const [isInitialLoading, setIsInitialLoading] = useState(true);
const [isRefreshing, setIsRefreshing] = useState(false);
```

### 4. Add Development Mode Debugging

Add development-only logging to help identify infinite loops:

```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  console.log("RENDER COUNT:", ++renderCount);
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with new browser sessions**: Clear localStorage and test page loads
2. **Test with slow network**: Simulate slow API responses to catch race conditions
3. **Test rapid navigation**: Quickly navigate between pages to test cleanup
4. **Monitor console logs**: Look for repeated API calls or state updates

## Environment Differences

The issue occurring only locally but not in production suggests:

- Different caching behavior between environments
- Different network speeds affecting race conditions
- Different build optimizations
- Different localStorage persistence behavior

The fixes applied should resolve these issues across all environments.
