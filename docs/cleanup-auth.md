# Authentication System Cleanup

## Completed Changes

The authentication system has been consolidated into a single module. The following changes have been made:

- `serverAuth.ts` and `serverSideAuth.ts` have been deleted
- `auth.ts` now contains all server-side authentication logic
- All API routes have been updated to use the new `withAuth` middleware instead of direct `getServerSession` calls
- All usages of `unstable_getServerSession` have been replaced with `getServerSession`
- Client-side code uses the `useAuth` hook from `@/hooks/useAuth`

## Consolidated Architecture

The authentication system now follows this structure:

1. **Server-side API Authentication**
   - `withAuth` middleware for API routes
   - `getServerAuth` utility for retrieving the session
   
2. **Server-side Page Authentication**
   - `withServerSideAuth` for use in `getServerSideProps`
   - `checkServerSideAuth` utility for custom auth logic
   
3. **Client-side Authentication**
   - `useAuth` hook for components
   - `UserSession` utility for managing client-side session state

## Future Improvements

1. Continue to monitor for any legacy authentication patterns that might need updating
2. Consider implementing role-based middleware for more granular access control
3. Add more comprehensive testing for authentication flows

## Technical Implementation Details

- All authentication functions are centralized in `@/lib/auth.ts`
- NextAuth.js configuration remains in `@/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`
- Core authentication configuration is in `@/lib/authConfig.ts`
