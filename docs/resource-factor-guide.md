# Resource Factor (RF) Guide

## Overview

Resource Factor (RF) is a key metric in the production tracking system that measures and adjusts resource utilization for manufacturing operations. It provides insights into production efficiency, resource allocation, and helps with capacity planning.

## Definition

The Resource Factor represents the ratio of actual resources used compared to the standard resource allocation. By default, all operations start with an RF value of 1, indicating standard resource usage.

- **RF = 1**: Standard/expected resource utilization
- **RF > 1**: More resources were used than standard (potentially less efficient)
- **RF < 1**: Fewer resources were used than standard (potentially more efficient)

## Purpose and Usage

### 1. Resource Utilization Tracking

RF measures how efficiently resources (equipment, personnel, etc.) are being used compared to standard allocations. This data helps identify operations that consistently require more or fewer resources than planned.

### 2. Man-Hour Calculations

The system uses RF to calculate accumulated man-hours:

```
accumulatedManHours = productionHours * rf
```

Where `productionHours` is the actual time an operation took.

### 3. Capacity Planning

RF values affect resource allocation and capacity planning by providing data on resource consumption patterns. Operations with consistently high RF values might indicate areas where:

- Additional training may be required
- Equipment may need maintenance
- Process improvements should be considered

### 4. Efficiency Reporting

Reports use RF values to calculate overall efficiency metrics. These metrics help management track productivity trends and make informed decisions about resource allocation.

### 5. Operational Flexibility

The system allows operators to adjust RF values when resource usage differs from standard expectations. This flexibility acknowledges the variability in manufacturing processes while still collecting valuable data.

## Best Practices

1. **Accurate Recording**: Operators should accurately record RF values at operation completion based on actual resource usage
2. **Regular Analysis**: Management should regularly analyze RF trends to identify areas for improvement
3. **Context Matters**: Interpret RF values in context - sometimes higher RF values are justified (e.g., dealing with difficult materials)
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Use RF data to drive continuous improvement initiatives

## Implementation in the System

- RF values are input by operators when completing an operation
- Default value is 1 for all operations
- RF values are stored in the operations table in the database
- RF data is used in various reports and dashboards
- Change history for RF values is tracked in the audit logs

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Operation

- Operation runs as expected
- Standard resources used
- RF value recorded as 1

### Scenario 2: Efficiency Improvement

- Operation completed faster than standard
- Fewer resources required
- RF value recorded as 0.8 (20% resource savings)

### Scenario 3: Unexpected Challenges

- Operation encounters difficulties
- Additional resources required to complete
- RF value recorded as 1.5 (50% additional resources)

By properly tracking RF values, the organization can gain valuable insights into operational efficiency and resource utilization across the production process.
